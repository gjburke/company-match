This is a place to put the work that you have done without interfering with the shared project code. 

This will help people see your contributions since we aren't using a usual git workflow where you commit your own work. 

In order to upload your work, make sure you are on a separate branch other than main. 

1. You can make your own branch by doing 'git checkout -b "branch-name"'.
2. Then add a folder with your name on it to the folder and upload whatever files you would like to showcase as your work.
3. When you are done making your changes, push your branch to the github with 'git push origin branch-name'

Then I will be able to look and make sure that you haven't edited any of the main files, and I'll merge your branch so it'll show on the github!

This will help you show the contributions you've made within our slightly unorthodox system of using the github.
