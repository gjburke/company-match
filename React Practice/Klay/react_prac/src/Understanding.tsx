            From my perspective, the advantage of React is the introduction of components, which breaks the frontend into reusable blocks.<br/>
            The reusability of components make team working much easier since we can construct the whole frontend by composing the<br/>
            components written by different people. Moreover, relatively short code lengths(for each comp) makes it easier to debug React apps<br/>
            than pure H/C/J apps. React also supports tons of strong functionalities, some of which I know include react hooks and react-router.<br/>
